* **Topic**: Network Security for IoT Devices
* **Author**: Zihao Diao \<zhdiao@bu.edu\>

## Report

See the [report](./report) directory of the repo in the `main` branch.

* `report-proj1-zhdiao.pdf`: the report in the PDF format exported using [Typora](https://typora.io/) for the Markdown source file;
* `report-project-zhdiao.md`: the report in the Markdown format (the [GitHub flavor](https://github.github.com/gfm/) with Typora's $\LaTeX$ extension is used).

The two files are of the same content, the only difference is the format - thus different tools needed to open.
